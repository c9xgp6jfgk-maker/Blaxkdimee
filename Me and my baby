Happy Three Months Baby - Website
----------------------------------

Files included:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js

Important:
1) The site references a music file named: die-for-you-instrumental.mp3
   - Due to copyright, I could not include the commercial instrumental.
   - Please add your own copy of "Die For You (Instrumental) - The Weeknd" to the project root and name it exactly:
       die-for-you-instrumental.mp3
   - Or replace the filename in index.html with your own audio filename.

2) To deploy locally:
   - Open index.html in your browser (double-click).
   - For autoplay music, click "Click to Enter" (this triggers the audio play, bypassing browser autoplay restrictions).

3) To deploy on GitHub Pages:
   - Create a public repo and upload all files.
   - (If you want the music to play from GitHub Pages, upload the mp3 to the repo as well — be mindful of copyright and file size limits.)
   - In Settings -> Pages choose the main branch and root as the folder. The site will be published at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

4) Replace placeholder images/videos:
   - Replace photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, video1.mp4, video2.mp4 with your actual files.
   - If you don't have them yet, those elements remain as placeholders.

If you want, I can:
- Add a favicon,
- Replace placeholders with sample images you like,
- Generate a version without referencing the mp3 (link only).

Enjoy — Angela made this with love. ❤️
